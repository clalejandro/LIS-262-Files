				<h3>Workshop in PHNOG 2018</h3>
				<h5>By: Christine Alejandro, March 15, 2018</h5>
				<img src="PHNOG2018_workshop.jpg" style="width:100%">
				<p>PhNOG 2018 held a 2-day workshop last March 8 and 9 at the I'M Hotel in Makati. The workshop is about Network Monitoring and Management. Jonathan Brewer is the instructor. The participants are technical personnel from universities and telco companies.</p>

				<p>On the first day of the workshop, there was an icebreaker. The icebreaker was an online poll on the background of the participants. It was a fun activity to get to know the other participants.</p>

				<p>The topics discussed on day 1 were introduction to network monitoring and management, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), log management and Smokeping.</p>

				<p>On the second day of workshop, the topics discussed were configuration management, ticketing systems and LibreNMS.</p>

				<p>There were hands-on exercises during the workshop. The class were divided into several groups. The instructor had set up virtual routers which were used during the workshop. </p>

				<p>Overall, it was a productive 2-day workshop. For sure, the participants have learned a lot from the discussion and hands-on exercises.</p>
